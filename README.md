# AllInOne
 DrivePool balancing plugin, combining the functionality of several official plugins into a single plugin to avoid thrashing.
 
 Here's an example of the settings panel. Notice the 1.5 tb is set to not contain duplicated or unduplicated:

Balance result with those settings. Again note the 1.5tb is scheduled to move everything off the disk due to the settings above.

NOTE: I haven't yet rewritten the ordering plugin. It's currently just the raw disassembled source from the original ordering plugin (or well - the ordering portion of the SSD plugin), so it looks fairly ugly. If someone would like to take it upon themselves to clean up some of this, I'd appreciate it. I don't have much interest in the ordering portion myself, so I probably won't get around to it.
